This is a work in progress.

The goal of the `Lego` project is to provide a fundamental model for the evolution of biodiversity and organismal niche spaces. The `Lego` project is currently built around a mass-balance equation
```S
A + B = C
```
where `A` represents a species, `B` is the set of coproducts produced by the species, and `C` is the set of resources required by `A`.

`Speciation` occurs when `A` => `A'`, with coproducts `B'` and `C'` based on some mutation rate.
